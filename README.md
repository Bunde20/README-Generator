# README-Generator

## Client Needs:
- The client would like an application run by node.js to create a professional README based on user input.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- The user should be prompted with questions based on information that should be included in a README.
    - This was done creating a set of questions (initialized by the terminal command node index.js) that the user can answer to give information about their project.
- When the README questions have all been answered, the user should be presented with a professional README.
    - After all questions have been answered, a README.md file is created including the user input for them to save.
- If the user clicks on the table on contents, they should be directed to that section of the page.
    - If any section of the table of contents is selected, the user will be redirected to that area of the README.
